Existing verbs calculate all possible types of info needed 
and then select the ones specified in the format string.
May be more efficient to work out which types of info are 
required and only create them. Could create individual verbs
for each infotype then select appropriate verbs from gerund 
based on the format string:
NB. Given Day number (Julian or J equivalent)
NB. create a set of short verbs to retrieve individual formats
2 4 getYear
1 2 3 4 getMonth
1 2 3 4 getDay
1 2 getHour  (0 1 2 getAM)
1 2 getMinute
1 2 3 getSeconds
1 2 3 getMSeconds

Check fmtDate/fmtTime for codes, retreive matching verbs from gerund and apply to y
using eachunderv or eachv.
